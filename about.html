                A native Texan, I was born and raised on the South Plains of West Texas. After beginning our studies and earning our Associates degrees at South Plains College after high school, my wife and I both received Carr Scholarships from Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. We threw together a whirlwind wedding, packed our bags, and made a break for the city.

            <p class = "about_dr">
                I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology cum laude at Angelo State in 2000. After taking a year off, I was accepted tothe University of Houston College of Optometry in 2001. Vicki and I packed our bags again and made one more move. In thespring of 2005, I was chosen by my classmates and future colleagues to provide the Student Address for our graduation ceremony. It was, and it continues to be, one of the most humbling moments of my life. On that day, I also earned my Doctor of Optometry degree with magna cum laude honors from UHCO.

            <p class = "about_dr">
                I realize that as the person that you entrust with your or your loved one’s eyes, I have a great responsibility. In the time after my graduation, I worked several years alongside ophthalmologists in order to hone and expand my knowledge base in order to provide the best care I possibly can for my patients. It’s a responsibility I take seriously. It’s also what I love to do.
            </p>
            <p class = "about_dr">
                My staff and I welcome you to our practice. Certainly, if there is anything we can do for you, please let us know. We look forward to seeing you in the future!
